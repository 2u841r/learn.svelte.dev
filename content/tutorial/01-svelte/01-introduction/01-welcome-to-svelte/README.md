title: Welcome to Svelte
---

Welcome to the Svelte tutorial! This will teach you everything you need to know to easily build fast, small web applications.

You can also consult the [API docs](https://svelte.dev/docs) and the [examples](https://svelte.dev/examples), or — if you're impatient to start hacking on your machine locally — create a project with `npm init svelte`.

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a tool for building web applications. Like other user interface frameworks, it allows you to build your app _declaratively_ out of components that combine markup, styles and behaviours.

These components are _compiled_ into small, efficient JavaScript modules that eliminate overhead traditionally associated with UI frameworks.

You can build your entire app with Svelte (for example, using an application framework like [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)), or you can add it incrementally to an existing codebase. You can also ship components as standalone packages that work anywhere.

## How to use this tutorial

> You'll need to have basic familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand Svelte.

This tutorial is split into four main parts:

- [Welcome to Svelte](/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) (you are here)
- [Introduction to SvelteKit](/tutorial/introducing-sveltekit)
- [Advanced Svelte](/tutorial/advanced-svelte)
- [Advanced SvelteKit](/tutorial/advanced-sveltekit)

Each section will present a mini exercise designed to illustrate a feature of Svelte. Later sections build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so it's recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the dropdown above (click 'Introduction / Welcome to Svelte').

If you get stuck, you can click the `Solve` button to the left of the editor. Try not to rely on it too much; you will learn faster by figuring out where to put each suggested code block and manually typing it in to the editor.
